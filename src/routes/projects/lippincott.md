### At Lippincott, I worked as a jack of all trades Creative Technologist: Unity VR Development, AI and Web development, as well as UI/UX and motion design. While the details of the projects are under NDA, a broad description follows below.

## VR BRANDBOOK

I explored opportunites for brand and advertising through a VR brandbook and data visualization project. Based on Lippincott's work with a US major airline, we used a flight tracking API and airport datasets to tell a story about the airline's presence leading into a immersive brandbook showcasing Lippincott's work on the case.

## AI WEBTOOL

Emerging from a discussion with coworkers, I designed and developed a web-based tool leveraging AI to explore how generative AI can enhance Lippincott's core offerings. This tool was built with React.js, Flask, openAI APIs, and Stability API. The tool developed started out as a conversation starter or experiment but became polished enough to demo for clients and be deployed in Lippincott's internal network.

## LIPPINCOTT 'PLAY' WEBSITE

I was a developer for a soon to be released Lippincott website. I developed a set of custom motion components for the site's article pages with React.js and Framer.js. These components, based on scroll hijacking, break from a traditional article format, replacing it with a more interactive almost cinematic experience.

## UI/UX AND MOTION DESIGN

Throughout my time at Lippincott I also played the role of a more traditional visual designer. Starting out, I designed mobile versions of web pages and double checked content for a client website before graduating to making design decisions on desktop web pages as well. I was late slotted into a web banner design project in the last two weeks of a project and picked up Google Web Designer on a short notice, polishing my motion design skills.
