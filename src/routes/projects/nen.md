# Nen Creative â€“ I work as a designer and developer contractor on websites and branding for startups.

At Nen, I design low and high fidelity UI/UX wireframes for web with Figma. I implement the designs through Webflow, specializing in features requiring custom code. Acting both as designer and developer, I am able to ensure responsive design choices through iterative testing. I also translate engineering requirements for clients with expanded technical needs and feature requests.

## RESTATE.DEV

Restate is a startup working on creating backend infrastructure for distributed systems. During Restate's recent rebrand, I acted as a UI/UX designer and developer. I was brought on after the branding process was largely finished, creating mockups based on a loose design system. I then implemented those mockups in webflow, building out the site. 

During this project my secondary, but just as important role, was serving as a translator between the client and Nen for the client's technical needs. Along with addressing technical questions, I also created a series of diagrams and animations illustrating the product's technical capabilities. I created motion graphics for technical diagrams with Adobe After Effects and Lottie animations which I then implemented in the site tying progression to scroll behavior.
