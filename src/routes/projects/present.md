# PRESENT – a studio website for PRESENT.CO an experiential innovation studio based in NYC.

PRESENT.CO is a website I built with Hayoon Choi and Richard Zhou. I was approached by PRESENT to design and develop a portfolio website for their new company. They asked for a simple portfolio site accented with a webgl scroll animation. During the course of this project, I served as the primary point of contact with the client as well as a designer and engineer. We built the site with React and React Three Fiber and the associated CMS with Payload CMS.
