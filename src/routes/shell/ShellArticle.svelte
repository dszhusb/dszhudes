    <p class="text-base">
        The shell motif first started when I found George R. McGhee Jr's seminal
        work “Theoretical Morphology” abandoned in a hallway at CMU.

    <p>
        It presents a fascinating look into a mathematical perspective behind
        how the real and speculative models of organism growth.

        I was particularly struck by how shell morph as you tweak the parameters
        behind the model behind their construction. Building off of the formula
        described as well as making my own tweaks from my own experimentation
        and research, the first shell generator was born in Processing.

        From the early days in Processing to P5.js and Javacript and finally to
        SVGs and Typescript. This tool has come a long way.

        Feel free to play around and download your very own shell!
